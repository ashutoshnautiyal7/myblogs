            It’s no surprise that the tourist season is a difficult time to find accommodation in Ladakh. There is always a heavy rush in the Ladakh region with travellers coming in from all parts of the country to beat the heat.
After reaching locations such as the very popular Pangong Lake, tourists are known to find it very difficult to arrange for accommodation which leads to a lot of confusion, chaos and overcrowding.
Keeping this problem in mind, the tourism department authorities of Ladakh have requested all travellers to come to Ladakh with a proper booking of accommodations, especially while visiting the Pangong Lake area.
The reason being, Pangong Lake is a wildlife sanctuary and unplanned tourist activities and overcrowding would most definitely disturb the wildlife in the area. Also, there is only a limited number of accommodation in the lake area because it is a wildlife sensitive area.
One of the travel advisories asks travellers to restrict their travel to higher altitude areas like Khardung La, Chang La, Pangong Lake, Tso Moriri and Pensi La before completing 48 hours of acclimatisation.

            Vast green pastures, sheep and cow grazing on lush grass, high vegetation-rich mountains, dense jungles, orchards, farms and villages, English houses, churches — this is the typical scene in Himachal and Uttarakhand.

Though Spiti is one of the many Himachal Pradesh valleys, it is nothing like this.

In this Spiti valley trip guide, we will see Spiti is one of the most bizarre and gorgeous places on this planet. The altitude of Spiti is at least 4,000 meters even in the lowest parts of the valley. And don’t forget that Spiti is a Himalayan valley. The high altitude and the Himalayas make Spiti a unique place to live.

            Manali is one of the oldest towns in Kullu Valley. The place surrounds with the aura of ROMANCE everywhere, right from the hustle-bustle of mall road to the very calm, traditional, foreigners dominated old Manali to the woods/villages around/beyond Manu temple to the walking path around Hadimba temple. It can easily be called one of the ROMANTIC destinations of India.

The Hadimba goddess runs the Manali town and is the center of worship of the people living at Manali. The mighty goddess also governs the tall mountains along with raw nature, and it’s only after her permission that one gets to enjoy this beautiful place to the core. When people think of Manali, the second keyword that comes is, of course, Rohtang Pass which no doubt is a must-visit place if you go to Manali..

            There are two types of Desert Safari in Jaisalmer
            1.Camel Safari - The camel safari is one of the best safaris that you can take in the desert sands in Jaisalmer. This is one great way to explore the settlements in the region with the excellent view of the sunset. The best way to go about this safari is to begin a short bumpy ride on the camel to get the scenic view of the Sam Sand Dunes. Then enjoy the golden yellow sun as it sets at the back of the Sand Dunes.

            Before night, get a flashy yet traditional welcome with dhols, and aarti. Then spend the night enjoying the performance with a welcome drink and folk music playing in your favorite Desert Safari Camp in Rajasthan.                     
            
            
            
            
            2.Jeep Safari- If the speed of the jeep safari in the cloudy storms of the desert sands thrills you then this is one great activity that you should try out. This is one of the most popular tourist activity in Jaisalmer. The jeep is uncovered on top making the safari even more open for you to see the nature.

            Enjoy the adventure as you drive through the vast Thar Desert on wheels! In case you feel the camel safari is a bumpy ride and takes too long to explore the place, go in a jeep. It is for people to love speed  in the desert sands.
            
            Tourists opt for the jeep safari as it is faster, adventurous and gives a thrilling experience. If you go by the numbers then several visitors go on the jeep for fun. The open top 4×4 jeep takes a trip to Desert National Park also called Fossil Park, stops at the Sam Sand Dunes, and lastly to Padholi Sanctuary.
            
            If you like shorter trips, with speed, wind and sand dust, and exploring the best of the desert region, then go for Desert Jeep Safari in Jaisalmer and enjoy.

            cuba diving in Andaman and Nicobar islands is one of the biggest attractions, after relaxing around and tasting local seafood delicacies. This is one activity in Andaman that is operational throughout the year. One can see the amazing sea life among the world of awesome water bodies, vibrant fishes, awesome corals and seabed gardens in silent-as-night waters. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience until, of course, you do it once and then feel like doing it again and again!

There is a whole other world inside the ocean, waiting to be explored, and that’ll leave you amazed and bedazzled with its beauty. Under the protection of the Andaman Administration, the untouched corals and vibrant fishes are abundant and often enclose the diver from all directions, leaving the diver in awe and wonder. The underwater coastal belts surrounding Andaman is home to one of the densest ecosystems of coral reefs and formations. Most of the islands are enclosed by long stretches of reefs, usually several hundred meters wide and separated by the shore with shallow waters. They are also complemented by volcanic lava hills that make the experience unique and hard to find, offering the best scuba diving experience in Andaman as compared to anywhere else.

            Back in the day, Kasol was a place known amongst a select few circles – especially foreigners from predominantly Israel, Russia, and a few eastern European countries. The few Indians that explored this unknown region were the ones that truly belonged in the wild, withholding this particular place. Thanks to the easy availability of mesmerizing views, beautiful landscape, fantastic weather and of course, the Malana cream.

However, when the social media gained prominence, this little serene heaven gained popularity like no other. Kasol became a brand about chilling, trekking, hiking, getting lost in nature, and just enjoying some time off. With tonnes of treks and trails surrounding the entire Parvati Valley region, it soon got famous as the second home to the backpackers in India.

However, let’s look at some of the other interesting things to do in Kasol apart from capturing nature around.

Kasol Party: Well, if you are those who are looking into that party kind of culture, then you can attend various music parties that keep happening in Parvati Valley much similar to the ones in Old Manali.
Attend a music festival – Although not the same as the festivals of yesteryears, the music scene in Kasol is bona fide! Some of the more famous festivals are the Magica Festival, Parvati Peaking, and Shiva Squad Festival during summer months. The artists and DJs from all over the world are always excited to perform in the region. Their excitement is primarily so because their niche base happens to be in love with Kasol.

            How to reach Chopta?
Chopta is located in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand and lies on the Ukhimath – Chamoli – Gopeshwar road. Distance of Chopta from Haridwar is 225 kms and the distance from Ukhimath to Chopta is around 29 kms. To simplify the reaching part, let me start from Delhi. Chopta is located at an altitude of approx. 2650m.

Most people stay at Chopta, do a day hike to Tungnath and Chandrashila and come back the same day. It is possible to do it provided one leaves early, say by 7 am. It is best to reach Tungnath by 10, pay your respects at the temple and enjoy the scenery. Trek ahead to Chandrashila, come back by 1 pm. Eat lunch either near Tungnath temple or at the dhabas on the trail and start the walk back to Chopta. Remember that usually the time taken to go back is half of what you’d take while hiking up, so one can get back to Chopta in 2 hours from Chandrashila.

Trekking from Chopta to tungnath: 
The trekking path to Chopta begins right on the road and is surrounded by many dhabas and guest houses. The trekking trail is well marked and is properly paved till Tungnath. Trees welcome the visitor as soon as the trek begins, and an endless array of snow capped peaks can be seen on the left side. The entire trek from Chopta to Tungnath and to Chandrashila is fairly easy and does not require the services of a guide.

Gorgeous meadows appear around 45 minutes after the start of the trek and may make the best camping spot on the entire trail. There are 3-4 dhabas here that provide tea, coffee, food and packaged eatables. The dhabas also double up as basic shelters in the night. These dhabas may also prove useful in case of an emergency or accident when somehow needs help.
