// since we want our header and footer to be in all the pages so we will we have put header.jsx and footer.jsx in app.js  layout component


we are using swiper.js slider for our automatic carausel 

when we create a new route we create that page  inside our pages folder


// this file is created so that we can have we can access individual post via the post id ----> i.e dynamic routing 

// this {postid} file is a slug or we can say a variable


// to get the data from params we have------> req.query

// we have renamed posts file from /api/posts/posts/ to index.js  as  the /api/posts   route directly catches index.js file  as default
